          <h2>Climate Talks: Just Transition</h2>
          <p>
            On November 4, I had the opportunity to attend the Climate Talks
            seminar. The event featured three experts who shared their various
            experiences and knowledge about the issue of Climate Change as well
            as gave insights regarding on the Just Transition.
          </p>
          <p>
            As someone who is passionate about the environment, I was excited to
            learn more about just transition and how it relates to climate
            change. The speakers did a great job of explaining the concept and
            providing examples of how it has been implemented in different parts
            of the world. They also discussed the challenges and opportunities
            associated with just transition and how it can help mitigate the
            impacts of climate change. It was a really informative and
            thought-provoking seminar, and I left feeling more aware and
            empowered to take action on this important issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was a great experience to attend the seminar and learn
            from the experts about just transition and climate change. I was
            able to learn additional information about making effective use of
            my waste by recycling it, as well as other techniques.

          <h2>Walk for a Creation</h2>
          <p>
            I recently had the chance to attend a walk for creation event hosted
            by the Diocese of Dumaguete on October 21. The event was held to
            bring awareness to our environment and connect faith with the
            environment. As someone who values both my faith and the
            environment, I was excited to participate in the walk and learn more
            about how these two things intersect.
          </p>
          <p>
            The event was well organized and featured a variety of speakers and
            activities. The message of the walk was powerful and resonated with
            me. It was a great reminder of the importance of taking care of the
            earth and how our faith can motivate us to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was a meaningful and enriching experience to attend the

          <h2>Christmas Tree Volunteerism</h2>
          <p>
            I had the opportunity to participate in a Christmas-making
            volunteerism event last November 27 where I had to paint on a canvas
            based on a prompt. Although I am not an artistic person, working
            with my group of friends made the experience enjoyable.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were able to collaborate and come up with a unique and creative
            design for our canvas. It was great to see how our different ideas
            and styles came together to form a cohesive piece. As we painted, we
            also had the opportunity to represent our organization, RYLF. In the
            end, we were able to successfully complete the prompts and
            contribute not only to the event but also to our organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was a fun and fulfilling experience to participate in
            the Christmas-making volunteerism event and work with my friends to
            create something special.

          <h2>SUROTC Fundraising Food Kiosk</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            On November 20, I had the chance to support a fundraiser hosted by
            the SU ROTC unit. The fundraiser was held to raise funds for the
            Dumaguete city jail, and the ROTC unit decided to sell food as a way
            to generate income. As someone who values giving back to the
            community, I was excited to support the fundraiser and contribute to
            a good cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to purchase some food and was impressed by the quality and
            taste. The ROTC unit had clearly put a lot of effort into preparing
            the dishes and it showed in the final product. As I ate, I also had
            the opportunity to chat with some of the members of the ROTC unit
            and learn more about their motivations for hosting the fundraiser.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was a great experience to support the fundraiser hosted
            by the SU ROTC unit. Not only did I have the chance to contribute to
            a good cause, but I also had the opportunity to enjoy some delicious
            food and learn more about the ROTC unit and their efforts to help
            the community. It was a win-win situation and I was glad to be able
            to support such a worthy cause.

          <h2>Virtual Run/Ride for a Cause</h2>
          <p>
            On November 25, I had the chance to support a white gift giving
            event hosted by the SU ROTC unit. The event was held as part of a
            donation drive and featured a 5 km run as a way to raise funds for
            the gift-giving. Personally, as someone who likes giving back to the
            community and staying active, I was excited to participate in the
            event and do my part to support a good cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to run the 5 km and found it to be a challenging but
            enjoyable experience. It was a great way to stay active and push
            myself to achieve a goal. As I ran, I was also doing it with my
            other ROTC friends, which made the laps much more enjoyable. Not
            only that, I was able to meet other cadets who all had motivations
            for supporting the white gift giving event.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was a great experience to support the white gift giving

            contribute to a good cause, but I also had the opportunity to stay
            active and have a fun experience with other like-minded individuals.
            It was a meaningful and rewarding way to celebrate the holiday
            season and give back to the community.
