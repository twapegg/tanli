          Sports play an equally important part in the life of a Silliman
          student. The campus boasts of facilities for ball games, swimming,
          contact sports, and archery. In the field of archery, Mark Javier, the
          lone Filipino male archer in the Beijing Olympics, is a fresh addition
          to the list of Sillimanian Olympians: archers Jennifer Chan and Lisa

          <h2>Hibalag Leaderboards</h2>
          <p>
            On August 24, I participated in a tournament at school called
            Hibalag Leaderboards. It was a competition featuring various video
            games, and I chose to compete in osu, a rhythm game. I had been
            practicing osu for a while and felt confident in my abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the day of the tournament arrived, I was nervous but excited to
            see how I would do. As it turned out, my hard work paid off and I
            ended up winning first place in the osu category. It was a great
            feeling to be recognized for my skills and to know that all of my
            practice had paid off. I received a certificate as well as a cash
            prize for being first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, participating in the Hibalag Leaderboards tournament was a
            fantastic experience and I am grateful for the opportunity to
            compete and showcase my abilities.

          <h2>Igniting Creativity thru Card Games</h2>
          <p>
            On August 22, I joined a Jackbox party session hosted by a teacher I
            had just met, Sir Te. At first, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I
            quickly found that the sessions were a lot of fun. Sir Te was a
            great host and had a great sense of humor, which really added to the
            enjoyment of the sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was also great to be able to engage with other people and have
            some fun while still in the comfort of my own home. As the sessions
            went on, I found myself looking forward to them more and more. The
            experience was chill yet excitingly fun as we answer trivia
            questions and see who the better guesser is.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, joining the Jackbox party sessions was a great experience
            and I am grateful for the opportunity to connect with others and
            have a good time. It was also due to this that I was able to meet my
            favorite teacher, sir Te.

          <h2>Dota 2 Tournament: "Rising Star"</h2>
          <p>
            I recently had the opportunity to watch a Dota 2 tournament hosted
            by a local gaming cyber cafe on November 20. The tournament was
            hosted by Groundzero and featured some of the best teams in the
            area.
          </p>
          <p>
            As someone who loves video games, I was excited to see some
            high-level competition in person. Even though I haven't been able to
            play any games lately due to school, watching the different teams
            compete sparked something within me. It reminded me of how much I
            love gaming and how much fun it can be to watch skilled players in
            action.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tournament was intense and there were some close matches, but in
            the end, one team came out on top. It was a great experience to see
            such talented players in action and it has inspired me to get back
            into gaming and continue to improve my own skills.

            funshoot for tweens and teenagers. The event was held at Pantawan, a

            added an extra element of excitement to the competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I watched the archers take their shots, I was amazed by their
            focus and determination. Even though some of the participants were
            beginners, they still gave it their all and tried their best to hit
            the target. It was inspiring to see how much they had improved over
            the course of the event and how much they enjoyed the sport.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was a great experience to watch the archery funshoot and
            see the progress and passion of the young archers.

            event for women on November 19. The event was held at a local beach
            and had a mix of experts and beginners who were playing.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I watched the matches, I was impressed by the athleticism and
            teamwork of the players. They moved seamlessly around the court,
            setting up perfect passes and making impressive spikes and blocks.
            Even though some of the teams were more experienced than others,
            every player gave it their all and tried their best to come out on
            top.
          </p>
