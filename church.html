          Christian faith is foundational to Silliman education. Various
          activities for faith nurture, education, worship, fellowship, and
          service are in store for Silliman students all year round. These are
          activities that are receptive to the changing needs and preferences of
          students. Church activities are designed and organized in a way that
          does not discriminate students from other religious denominations.

          <h2>Opening Devotion</h2>
          <p>
            On August 22, I had the opportunity to attend the opening devotion
            for our college of computer studies to kick off the celebration of
            the university's founding anniversary. It was a special and
            meaningful event, as it marked the beginning of a week-long series
            of activities and events to honor the history and legacy of our
            university.
          </p>
          <p>
            The devotion was held in the ATA hall and was attended by CCS
            students together with the Confed. The atmosphere was filled with
            excitement and a sense of community as we came together to seek a
            moment with God before we start the celebrations. The program
            included a prayer, a singing of the national anthem, and a few
            inspirational words from a pastor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was a faithful and uplifting experience to participate
            in the opening devotion. I'm grateful to have been a part of this
            special occasion as it left me looking forward to the rest of the
            celebrations throughout the week.

          <h2>University Prayer of Peace</h2>
          <p>
            On September 21, I had the opportunity to attend a university prayer
            of peace organized by the Silliman History and Political Science
            Society. The purpose of the prayer was to offer prayers for the
            victims of martial law in the Philippines, and to remind people that
            we must not forget what happened during that time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The prayer was held outside the Luce auditorium and was attended by
            students from different departments. The atmosphere was solemn and
            respectful as we came together to remember those who suffered and to
            reaffirm our commitment to peace and justice. The program included a
            prayer, a moment of silence, and a few words from a few select
            students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was a moving and meaningful experience to participate in
            the university prayer of peace. I'm grateful to have been a part of
            this important event and I'm committed to working towards a more
            peaceful and just society.

          <h2>All-University Academic Convocation</h2>
          <p>
            On September 28, I had the opportunity to attend the university's
            academic convocation. It was a prestigious and formal event that
            marked the beginning of the academic year. The convocation was held
            in the Luce auditorium and was attended by students, faculty, and
            staff from all colleges.
          </p>
          <p>
            The highlight of the program included the words by the university
            president, who talked about the progress of Silliman and its future
            road ahead. It was interesting to learn about the various
            initiatives and projects that the university is working on, and how
            they contribute to the development of the institution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was a wonderful and informative experience to attend the
            academic convocation. I'm grateful to have been a part of this
            special occasion and I'm looking forward to the opportunities and

          <h2>Midweek Service</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            On November 16, I had the opportunity to attend a mass service held
            by the Silliman Church as part of the university's Christian life
            emphasis month. It was a special and meaningful event that brought
            together students, faculty, and staff from all departments to
            worship and celebrate our faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mass was held in the SU church and was attended by a large crowd
            of people. The atmosphere was peaceful and spiritual as we sang
            hymns, listened to the sermon, and participated in the sacraments.
            The service was led by the pastor and assisted by members of the
            choir and altar servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was a wonderful and uplifting experience to attend the
            mass service. I'm grateful to have been a part of this special

          <h2>Galilean Fellowship</h2>
          <p>
            On November 17, I had the opportunity to attend a fellowship called
            Galilean Fellowship. It was a gathering of students taking the
            course CHS1, where we were able to get to know more about the book
            of Samuel. The fellowship was held in front of the ampitheater and
            SU church and was led by multiple facilitators who guided us through
            a discussion and reflection on the themes and messages of the book.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was a lead performer of my group and I was able to initiate and
            lead my groupmates to be able to successfully provide an excellent
            output required for our group project. It was a challenging but
            rewarding experience, as I had to make sure that everyone was on
            track and that our project met the required standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was a meaningful and enriching experience to attend the
            Galilean Fellowship. I'm grateful to have been a part of this
            special event as it further increased not only my faith but also my
            leadership abilities.
