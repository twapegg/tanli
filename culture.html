          <h2>Movie Night</h2>
          <p>
            Last August 22, my friends and I had a movie night together with the
            college of computer studies. We watched "Everything, Everywhere, All
            at Once," a absurdist comedy-drama film. The plot centers on a
            chinese family who runs a laundromat, the mother discovers she must
            connect with parallel universe versions of herself to prevent a
            powerful being from destroying the multiverse.
          </p>
          <p>
            The film was a swirling mix of genre anarchy, with elements of black
            comedy, science fiction, fantasy, martial arts, and animation. The
            special effects were impressive, and the acting was superb. I did
            not expect the movie to have such a sad ending, due to the comedic
            theme. The movie left me pondering about its beautiful quotes and
            messages about relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was a unique, entertaining, and dramatic film that kept
            us engaged and laughing throughout. After the movie ended, I was
            left with sadness because of its message on love and loyalty.
            Nonetheless, it was a great night spent with good friends and a
            fantastic film.

          <h2>Parada Sillimaniana</h2>
          <p>
            On the morning of August 22nd, I arrived at the university campus
            ready to participate in the celebration of the school's founding
            anniversary. As I made my way to the grandstand seats, I could feel
            the excitement in the air. When the parade began, each college
            presented a dance, adding to the lively atmosphere. The floats and
            marching bands added to the festive atmosphere, and I was thoroughly
            enjoying myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the parade progressed, I was struck by the sense of community and
            unity on display. Students from all different majors and backgrounds
            came together to celebrate this momentous occasion. The grand finale
            dance performance by all of the colleges combined was a particularly
            highlight for me, as the vibe and enthusiasm brought the celebration
            to a goosebumps-giving climax.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, attending the parade in celebration of the university's
            founding anniversary was a truly memorable experience. The lively
            atmosphere, diverse array of performances, and sense of community
            all contributed to a truly festive occasion. I left the parade
            feeling proud to be a part of this special community and looking
            forward to many more celebrations to come.

          <h2>Demokra-Sine</h2>
          <p>
            On September 21, I had the opportunity to attend a film showing of
            "Dekada '70," which was hosted by the Silliman History and Political
            Science Society. It was a powerful and poignant portrayal of a
            Filipino family during the martial law era in the Philippines. The
            film follows the story of Amanda Bartolome, a mother of five, who
            witnesses the tumultuous events of the time through the eyes of her
            family as they struggle to survive and fight for their rights and
            freedoms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The film shed light on the important historical events and social
            issues of the time, such as student activism, government corruption,
            and gender inequality. It was a thought-provoking and eye-opening
            reminder of the struggles and sacrifices of those who fought for
            democracy and human rights during this painful period in Philippine
            history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was a deeply moving and impactful film that left a
            lasting impression on me. I am grateful for the opportunity to have
            seen it and for the chance to learn more about this important
            chapter in Philippine history.

          <h2>Confederates Student Council IPR</h2>
          <p>
            On October 12, I had the opportunity to attend a team-building
            activity for my college department's student council, the
            Confederates Student Council. It was a really fun and enriching
            experience, as we got to interact with one another and learn more
            about each other's strengths and weaknesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the highlights of the day was a series of trust-building
            exercises that we did together. These activities required us to rely
            on each other and work as a team in order to complete them
            successfully. It was really gratifying to see how well we all worked
            together and supported one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another highlight was the opportunity to bond and get to know each
            other better. As a student council, it's important that we are able
            to work together effectively, and this team-building activity really
            helped to deepen our teamwork and build stronger relationships
            within the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, the team-building activity was a great success and we all
            had a lot of fun. It was a great opportunity for us to come together
            as a team and learn more about each other, and I think it will
            really help us to work more effectively as a student council moving
            forward.

          <h2>College Acquaintance Party</h2>
          <p>
            On September 22, I had the opportunity to attend an acquaintance
            party for my college of computer studies. The theme of the party was
            post-apocalyptic, and we were all encouraged to dress up in
            post-apocalyptic themed clothes. It was a really fun and unique
            theme, and it was interesting to see everyone's different takes on
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the party, we played a few games to get to know each other
            better and have some fun. Unfortunately, there was a heavy rain in
            the middle of the games, but that didn't dampen our spirits. We
            still managed to enjoy ourselves and have a great time together.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the highlights of the party for me was the food and the
            company of my friends. It was a great opportunity to bond and get to
            know more of my other peers in my college.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, despite the rain, the acquaintance party was a great
            success. It was a fun and unique way to get to know my fellow peers
            and seniors and start the school year off on a positive note. I'm
            looking forward to future events and getting to know my fellow
            college friends even better.

          <h2>Silliman University College Acquaintance Party</h2>
          <p>

            orientation for students from various colleges. It was a really

            really fun and festive way to conclude the event. It was a great

          <h2>CCS Christmas Party</h2>
          <p>
            On December 17, I attended the Christmas party for our college
            department. The theme was a cozy, pajama party and the main event
            was film watching night. It was such a fun and relaxing evening.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a committee vice-head of the secretariat committee, I had the
            responsibility of securing permits and concocting captions for the
            Confed's facebook posts advertising the Christmas party. I had the
            opportunity to learn more about dealing with documents with my
            senior, the head of the committee, as well as come up with creative
            and witty captions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the party came to an end and I left, I realized that I was going
            to miss my friends as I won't be seeing them until Christmas break
            ends. It was a bittersweet moment, but I'm already looking forward
            to the next time we can all get together and have a cozy night in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, this whole event was insightful and fun, it was a fantastic
            evening spent with great friends and lots of laughter. I'm grateful
            to have had the opportunity to attend such a memorable and enjoyable
            Christmas party.
