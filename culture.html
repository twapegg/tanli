          Every semester, the Cultural Affairs Committee stages five shows that
          put value on the appreciation for the arts at what most consider as
          the “cultural center of the south”: the Claire Isabel McGill Luce
          Auditorium. Silliman students get a taste of the works of nationally-
          and internationally-acclaimed literary, visual and performing artists
          throughout the school year. Season tickets at subsidized rates are
          made available to students.

          <h2>Parada Sillimaniana</h2>
          <p>
            On the morning of August 22nd, I arrived at the university campus
            ready to participate in the celebration of the school's founding
            anniversary. As I made my way to the grandstand seats, I could feel
            the excitement in the air. When the parade began, each college
            presented a dance, adding to the lively atmosphere. The floats and
            marching bands added to the festive atmosphere, and I was thoroughly
            enjoying myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the parade progressed, I was struck by the sense of community and
            unity on display. Students from all different majors and backgrounds
            came together to celebrate this momentous occasion. The grand finale
            dance performance by all of the colleges combined was a particularly
            highlight for me, as the vibe and enthusiasm brought the celebration
            to a goosebumps-giving climax.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, attending the parade in celebration of the university's
            founding anniversary was a truly memorable experience. The lively
            atmosphere, diverse array of performances, and sense of community
            all contributed to a truly festive occasion. I left the parade
            feeling proud to be a part of this special community and looking
            forward to many more celebrations to come.
