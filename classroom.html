          <p>
            On August 23, I had the opportunity to attend a lecture series given
            by Dr. John Boaz Lee, an alumnus of Silliman who now works at
            Facebook. The lecture focused on the topic of jobs in IT and

            conducts research at Facebook. He shared his insights and
            experiences on how a PhD can open up doors to exciting career
            opportunities in academia and industry. He emphasized the importance

          <p>
            On August 23, I had the opportunity to attend a guidance and
            counseling session where the counselor assessed our overall
            experience and mental health during our period of studying in the

            provided us with insights and strategies on how to better prepare
            ourselves for the change to hybrid learning mode, where face-to-face
            sessions will now be implemented. She emphasized the importance of
            self-care and communication, and gave us tips on how to manage our
            time and emotions effectively.
          </p>

          <p>
            Attending the Industry Lecture on August 23 at the ATA Hall was a

            their experiences in working their way up to where they currently
